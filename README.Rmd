Bayesian models to estimate causal effects of biological treatments on time-to-event endpoints in clinical trials with principal strata defined by the occurrence of antidrug antibodies.

## Scope

- The package contains functions to fit Bayesian principal stratification models and to perform clinical trial simulations to determine operating characteristics for given scenarios.
- Two-arm clinical trials of biological therapies are considered 
  - with an intercurrent event (determining the principal stratum of interest) that can only occur in the treated arm (such as the development of antidrug antibodies), and
  - with a time-to-event endpoint that is assumed to follow an exponential distribution.
- Effect estimators are hazard ratios and restricted mean survival times.
- Potential predictors of the intercurrent event can be taken into account.
- The models are fitted by Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling, they are coded in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and precompiled.
- More flexible time-to-event distributions (piecewise-exponential and Weibull) will be considered in future versions of the package.



## Principal stratification methodology

- Principal stratification is an approach to estimate causal effects in partitions of subjects determined by post-treatment events. It was introduced in the biostatistical literature by @Frangakis2002.
- The ICH E9 (R1) addendum on estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials proposed principal stratification as one approach to deal with intercurrent events in clinical trials (@ICHE9R1Guideline).
- Principal stratum membership is typically not known with certainty. A Bayesian approach may be particularly suited to deal with this type of uncertainty. Following a proposal by @Imbens1997, principal stratum membership can be treated as a latent mixture variable. 
- Motivated by scientific questions arising in clinical trials of biological therapies, in this package the approach by @Imbens1997 is adapted to a specific clinical trial setting with a time-to-event endpoint and the intercurrent event only occurring in the treated group. 
- For recent reviews of applications to clinical trials see @Lipkovich2022 and @Bornkamp2021.
